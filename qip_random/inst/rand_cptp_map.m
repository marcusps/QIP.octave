% QIP.RANDOM.CPTP_MAP  Random completely positive trace preserving map
% requires: qip.ket, qip.bra, qip.random.unitary, kron
% author: Marcus da Silva
%
%    L = qip.random.superoperator(d,e) returns the column-major
%    liouville representation of a random superoperator acting on a d
%    dimensional Hilbert space, with an E dimensional environment. 
%    The superoperator is chosen by generating Haar distributed
%    unitary acting on the joint system, and performing a partial trace.
