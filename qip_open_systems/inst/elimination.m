% QIP.OPEN_SYSTEMS.ELIMINATION   Generates an elimination matrix.

%    M = ELIMINATION(D) Generates an elimination matrix acting of the 
%    vectorization of a D by D matrix. When M multiplies such a vector, 
%    the result is a smaller vector consisting of only the upper-triangular
%    part of the matrix, in vectorized form.
