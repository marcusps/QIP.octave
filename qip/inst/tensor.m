% TENSOR  Tensor product
% author: Toby Cubitt ( http://www.dr-qubit.org )
% requires: none
%
%   m = TENSOR(a,b,c,...) returns the kronecker product of its arguments.
%
%   Each argument should either be a matrix, or a cell array containing a
%   matrix and an integer. In the latter case, the integer specifies the
%   repeat count for the matrix, e.g. TENSOR(a,{b,3},c) =
%   TENSOR(a,b,b,b,c).
