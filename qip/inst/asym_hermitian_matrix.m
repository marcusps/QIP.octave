% ASYM_HERMITIAN_MATRIX  Tensor product
% author: Marcus da Silva
% requires: none
%
%   A = asym_hermitian_matrix( M ) returns a real-valued
%   representation of a hermitian matrix where the diagonals remain
%   unchanged, the uppter triangular part of A is the real part of
%   the upper triangular part of M, and the lower triangular part
%   of A is the imaginary part of the upper triangular part of M.
