% QIP.RANDOM.MIXED_STATE  Random density matrix
% author: Marcus da Silva
% requires: qip.random.unitary
%
%   M = qip.random.mixed_state(D) returns a D by D hermitian matrix
%   D with unity trace.
%
%   The matrix is generated as follows: the eigenvalues are
%   randomly chosen from a uniform distribution on the probability
%   simplex (known as the DIrichlet distribution), and the
%   diagonalization transformation is chosen from the Haar
%   distribution of unitaries.
